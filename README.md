# Graph Algorithm Visualizer

Building using Vanilla/Pure javascript no external libraries used

work in progress(WIP)

current demo

![Demo screen shot]("images/forward and back".jpg)

this is a tool to draw graph and visualize the various algorithms on it 

Available animations to visualize :-

1)Depth first search(TRAVERSAL ALGORITHM)
2)Breadth First search(TRAVERSAL ALGORITHM)
3)Dijsktra algorihtm(SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHM)
4)Prim's algorithm(MINIMAL SPANING TREE)
5)Kruskal algorithm(MINIMAL SPANING TREE)

more animations will be added.....

INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING NODES:-

to add a node choose the "add" button from the above panel and click on the workspace a node will be added.

to delete a node choose the delete button from above pane and click on the node ,the node will be deleted.

to connect two nodes choose the connect button, click on a node the node will be foccused, now click on other nodes to connect the foccused, to remove the foccus click on a empty place the current foccused node will be removed.

you can choose the type of connection to add between nodes ,the following are the supported types:- "unidirectional unweighted" "directional unweighted" "unidirectional weighted" "directional weighted".

to delete a connection between two nodes click on the connections in delete mode.

to move a node choose the move button, and now you can drag and drop the nodes to desired position.

INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING WORKSPACE:-

Use scroll button to zoom in and zoom out.
click with middle button and drag to move the workspace.


INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING ANIMATIONS:-

choose a foccus node.
choose the desired algorithm.
click on "bake animation" button to prepare the animation.
now you can click the "play button" to watch the animation.
after clicking play the play button will change to stop.

you can drag the animation slider to jump to desirable stage of animation.
also you can use the arrow buttons near the play button to move the animation forward anf backward.
